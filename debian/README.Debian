In order to use dynmips you need to have a Cisco IOS Image for 7200
Router Series. The Image is not part of this software!


Dynamips is not DSFG compliant and will be included in non-free until
"mircocode" binary in source tree is compilable from source. Therefor a
Cross-Compiler-Environment is needed, which is not the case right now.
