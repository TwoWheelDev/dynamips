In order to use dynamips you need to have a Cisco IOS Image a Cisco
Router. The Image is not part of this software!

Dynamips is not DSFG compliant and will be included in non-free until
"microcode" binary in source tree is compilable from source. Therefore a
Cross-Compiler-Environment is needed, which is not the case right now.
